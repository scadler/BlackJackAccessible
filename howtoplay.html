                    is to get as close as possible to 21 points without going over 21 points.
                    Cards 2-10 are worth face value, face cards are worth 10 points, aces can
                    be worth 1 or 11 points. To change the value of an ace click on it. A blackjack is when the first two cards that you are dealt are an ace along with any face card.</p>
                    <p class="text">After "Deal" is clicked you are dealt two cards. When
                    "Hit" is click you are dealt an additional card per click.
                    A score that is more than 21 points results in an immediate loss.
                    After "Stay" is clicked the dealer's turn starts.
