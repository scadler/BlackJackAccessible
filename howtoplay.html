                    <p class="text one">Each player is dealt 2 cards. Your cards are on the left while the dealer's are on the right. The objective of this game
                    is to get as close as possible to 21 points without going over 21 points.
                    Cards 2-10 are worth face value, face cards are worth 10 points, aces can
                    be worth 1 or 11 points. To change the value of an ace click on it. A blackjack is when the first two cards that you are dealt are an ace along with any face card.</p>
                    <p class="text one">After "Deal" is clicked you are dealt two cards. When
                    "Hit" is clicked you are dealt an additional card per click.
                    A score that is more than 21 points (with no aces to flip) results in an immediate loss.
                    After "Stay" is clicked the dealer's turn starts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text one">If you want to keep track of your own score, wins are worth 5 points, loses cost you 5 points, and blackjacks award you 10 points</p>
